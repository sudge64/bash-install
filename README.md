# bash-install
 A collection of bash scripts to setup my Linux installations just as I prefer them. This project can be considered a sequel/replacement for my `ansible_configuration` repo.

## Installation

You must `cd` into the repo directory and run the command `sudo chmod a+x *.sh` in order to have the necessary permissions to run the scripts.
